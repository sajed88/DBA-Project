Case Study

AlBayan is a library that provides book rental services to its members. The library was first established in 2000 in Ramallah as its main branch. Due to its success, AlBayan expanded its operations and opened branches in Amman and Dubai to serve more customers.

AlBayan employs around 200 staff members across its branches. Whenever a new staff member joins the library, AlBayan staff registration form is used to create their account.

Each branch of AlBayan, including the main branch in Ramallah and the branches in Amman and Dubai, has a Branch Manager responsible for the day-to-day operations. Several Supervisors oversee groups of staff members within each branch.

The library maintains a comprehensive stock of books for rental at each branch. Each book is uniquely identified using an ISBN (International Standard Book Number). However, there are often multiple copies of the same book available at each branch, and individual copies are identified using a book number.

To rent books from AlBayan, customers must become registered members. During the registration process, customers are required to complete AlBayan's member registration form. The library currently has around 20000 registered members across all branches. 

Once registered, members are allowed to rent up to a maximum of 5 books at any given time from any branch, including the main branch in Ramallah, the branch in Amman, or the branch in Dubai. When a member decides to borrow one or more books, AlBayan rental form is completed, and rental charges are applied. Members are expected to return their books within 14 days from the borrowing date to the branch from which they borrowed the books. Any books returned after the due date accrue, late fines will be paid based on the number of days overdue.

Members have the option to provide feedback on the books they have read. They can rate books on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest rating, along with an optional short comment. Each member is allowed to give feedback for each book they have read only once.
